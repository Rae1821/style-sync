## Style Sync: Where technology meets your style

Style Sync is a tech centered fashion website that helps users find their perfect outfits through understanding their body shape and their personal style. With the help of AI they are able to upload a picture of a piece of clothing and get tailored outfit ideas plus a personal shopping experience as the AI helps you find the perfect items.

## Tech Used

Style Sync was built using Next.js with Typescript. I used Prisma for my schemas and MongoDB for my database. TailwindCSS is the best way to go IMO for CSS and I used shadcn components for a seamless look and feel.

## Project Goals

I built an earlier version of this project a couple of years ago that was centered around a body shape calculator where a user can input their measurements and find out their body shape. I wanted to take this a step further and in this project I added the ability to find your fashion style through a style quiz.

This all stems from my love of fashion and knowing that most women struggle with styling and picking out outfits for themselves. Businesses such as Stitchfix (who I'd love to work for ) and Daily Look aim to solve this problem by providing personal styling services delievered to your door.

My goal with this project is to continue to push the idea of personal styling forward. Many complaints with the styling services include being sent the same items over and over again and their stylist not listening to them. These companies are restricted in their offerings according to the brands they have partnered with.

A long term goal of this project would be to have AI search multiple websites for the user as a 'personal shopper' returning the items that best match the item they are trying to style according to both their body shape and their fashion style.

This is my passion project so always looking for ways to make it bigger and better.
